# Amplitude and Angle Modulations Project

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of amplitude modulation (AM), coherent and incoherent amplitude demodulation, frequency modulation (FM), frequency demodulation, as well as phase modulation and demodulation using FM. This was done as a part of the bonus assignment for the course EC31203 (Communications 1).

## Project Description

The project implements various modulation and demodulation techniques in MATLAB for communication systems. These techniques include:

- Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- Coherent and Incoherent Amplitude Demodulation
- Frequency Modulation (FM)
- Frequency Demodulation
- Phase Modulation and Demodulation using FM

## Project Questions

The project addresses the following questions:

1. Implement an amplitude modulator in MATLAB without using inbuilt functions. Plot both time and frequency domain plots of the amplitude modulated output for various modulation indices.
   
2. Implement a coherent amplitude demodulator in MATLAB without using inbuilt functions. Demodulate the modulated output and compare with the original message signal. Plot both time and frequency domain plots of the demodulated output for various modulation indices.
   
3. Implement an incoherent amplitude demodulator (envelope detector) in MATLAB without using inbuilt functions. Demodulate the modulated output and compare the results with the coherent demodulation. Plot both time and frequency domain plots of the demodulated output for various modulation indices.
   
4. Implement a frequency modulator in MATLAB without using inbuilt functions. Plot both time and frequency domain plots of the frequency modulated output.
   
5. Implement a frequency demodulator in MATLAB without using inbuilt functions. Demodulate the modulated output and plot both time and frequency domain plots of the demodulated output.
   
6. Use the FM modulator and demodulator designed in previous steps to perform phase modulation and demodulation respectively. Plot the outputs of modulated and demodulated signals in both time and frequency domains.

## Note

- Replace the `videoplayback.wav` file with your desired audio input.
- Adjust parameters as needed for different modulation indices, center frequencies, etc.
